# Ghost-Plan
Thriller Puzzle game inspired by The Sixth Sense movie.

## Overview
Ghost Plan is a video game inspired by the movie "The Sixth Sense". The game puts the player in the shoes of a curious 8-year-old boy who is able to see and communicate with ghosts. The game's main objective is to help these ghosts "complete unsolved problems" they have left in the world so that they can move on to the next world.

## Gameplay
As the player, you will need to decipher the clues left by the ghosts to understand how to help them. For example, you may encounter a spirit who was a musician in the past but did not have time to finish their last piece. You will need to explore their past and figure out how to help them complete their last musical piece.

As the character is a child, the game will include complex dialogues with adults that the player will need to navigate in order to continue their tasks. This creates a sense of tension and risk, as the player cannot reveal their secret as no one will believe them.

## Challenges
The challenges in Ghost Plan include navigating through complex dialogues with adults, deciphering clues left by the ghosts, and figuring out how to help them complete their unfinished business. Additionally, as a child, the player is limited in what they can do and must avoid revealing their secret.

## Conclusion
Overall, Ghost Plan is a unique game that provides an immersive experience for players. With its complex dialogues, mysterious clues, and difficult challenges, players will feel as though they are part of the movie "The Sixth Sense". The game is perfect for anyone who loves solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries.
